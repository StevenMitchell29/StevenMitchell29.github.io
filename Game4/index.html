<h2>Puzzle gone wrong</h2>
<ul>

<li><strong>High Concept:</strong>
A puzzle piece is stranded and trying to find all family members
</li>

<li><strong>Theme:</strong>
I used both themes
</li>

<li><strong>Mandated Variety:</strong>
Inputs are throught the arrow keys.  The puzzle family are randomly put around the screen.
</li>

<li><strong>Player Experience Goals:</strong>
I want the players to experience what an easy game is like to play.  Also that they are helping the world.
</li>

<li><strong>Gameplay:</strong>
The player uses the arrow keys the move accordingly.  Once the player is touching a bad man the score is changed to +1.  There are 20 family puzzles and the player is trying to get them all

</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Goal:</strong>
User input through the arrow keys
</li>

<li><strong>Features:</strong>
The incredible background

</li>

<li><strong>Setting/Premise:</strong>
The puzzle piece is trying to reconnect with his/her family

<li><strong>Story:</strong>
Please see above.
</li>

<li><strong>Target Audience:</strong>
People who want to a family friendly story

</li>

<li><strong>Play Time:</strong>
a couple minutes</li>

<li><strong>Strategies:</strong>
always be moving

</li>
